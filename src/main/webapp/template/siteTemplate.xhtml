        A favicon (short for favorite icon), also known as a shortcut icon, website icon, tab icon, 
        URL icon or bookmark icon, is a file named favicon.ico See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon
        The icon is displayed to the left of the page title on a tab in the Chrome web browser.
        The link below enables all your UI pages to display the favorite icon.
        
        Use EL to get the image file since it will be referenced by all UI pages.

            The Site Template file layout design consists of three components:
                1. Header Component (Typically is the same for the entire UI)
                2. Editable Content Component (each page creates its own content)
                3. Footer Component (Typically is the same for the entire UI)

            =====================================
            * Header Component of this Template *
            =====================================
            The header component is displayed on the top of each page created based on this siteTemplate.
            Changes made in the header component will show up automatically with all pages created 
            based on this siteTemplate for the entire site, achieving great maintainability.
            -->
            <div id="header">
                <ui:insert name="header" >
                    <ui:include src="headerTemplate.xhtml" />
                </ui:insert>
            </div>

            <!--
            The ui:insert tag is a templating tag that declares a named content element
            to be defined by another Facelet. It can be used effectively with the
            ui:define tag to pass values between Facelets (JSF pages).
            
            The ui:include tag is a server-side include tag for Facelets. It simply includes
            the document pointed to by the "src" attribute as part of the current JSF page.
            The included document should use a component or composition tag to trim unnecessary
            markup, or it may simply contain a fragment of XHTML or XML to be included.

            ===============================================
            * Editable Content Component of this Template *
            ===============================================
            Any page created based on this template is expected to provide its own content
            by using <ui:define name="editableContent">. If the page content is not defined,
            contentTemplate's content will be used as default. 
            
            The Growl statements in the growlMessages.xhtml file are automatically included at the
            top of the editableContent of every page created based on this template. This prevents 
            manually including the Growl statements in every JSF page. 
            
            This approach also enables maintainability since you can modify how the Growl messages
            are displayed only in one place for all of the UI pages of your software application.
            -->
            <div id="editableContent">
                <ui:insert name="growlMessages" >
                    <ui:include src="growlMessages.xhtml" />
                </ui:insert>
                <ui:insert name="editableContent" >
                    <ui:include src="contentTemplate.xhtml" />
                </ui:insert>
            </div>

            <!--
            =====================================
            * Footer Component of this Template *
            =====================================
            The footer component is displayed on the bottom of each page created based on this siteTemplate.
            Changes made in the footer component will show up automatically with all pages created 
            based on this siteTemplate for the entire site, achieving great maintainability.
            -->
            <div id="footer">
                <ui:insert name="footer" >
