Marking the VideoController class as "implements Serializable" implies that
instances of the class can be automatically serialized and deserialized. 

Serialization is the process of converting a class instance (object)
from memory into a suitable format for storage in a file or memory buffer, 
or for transmission across a network connection link.

Deserialization is the process of recreating a class instance (object)
in memory from the format under which it was stored.
